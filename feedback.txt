-1 cFuncDeclNode::Insert adds no functionality above AddChild, so you might as well just call AddChild.

-1 Some of your indentation was way off. I suspect it's because you have mixed spaces and tabs. You should convert to all spaces (there's a linux utility that will do it for you).

-3 Your cFuncDeclNode implementation will make it hard to write getters for all the parts. For example, where are the statements? in m_children[2], [3], or [4]?

-1 DecreaseScope should make sure the list isn't empty prior to the pop()

-13 You did not implement the global lookup as required by the write-up. You also do not have a local lookup visible in cSymbolTable as required by the write-up.

-5 Late. Your git repository indicates you finished on time, so I'm not taking the full late penalty.

Your git repository contains object files, etc. It should only contain source files.
